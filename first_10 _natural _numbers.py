# Set the number of natural numbers to print
n = 10  # We want to print the first 10 natural numbers

# Loop through numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
for i in range(1, n + 1):  # range(1, 11) generates numbers from 1 to 10
    # Print the current natural number
    print(i)  # Output the current number in the iteration
